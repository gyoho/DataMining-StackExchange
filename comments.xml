    <row Id="826764" PostId="49679" Score="0" Text="@Rinzwind I have successfully installed Ubuntu from the customized live cd even in a UEFI system with dual booting. Installed new packages and updated the all packaged along with kernel using `apt-get update` and `upgrade`. Everything went perfect. **EXCEPT** the systems (installed with customized live cd) does not have a `/etc/resolv.conf` (It is to be noted that `/etc/hosts` created as usual). Was it fine to remove `/etc/resolv.conf` in `chmod` environment? Anyway it is not a big deal, I have created a `resolv.conf` using `dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf`. Thanks a lot."
